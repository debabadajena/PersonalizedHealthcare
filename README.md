# PersonalizedHealthcare

The healthcare industry produces a large amount of raw health-care data daily that can be used to extract information for predicting disease that can happen to a patient in future while using the treatment history and health data. These data will be later used for effective decision making for patient’s health. This area has a very high scope of improvements by using informative data in healthcare. 
The importance of effective personalized patient treatment system where predictions based on a patient’s treatment history and health data can be used for personalized treatment; for recommending the doctors and medicines etc is missing in the current healthcare sector. Additionally, the risks of some patients being re-admitted in the hospital are often problematic as expenses tend to increase. The expected cost for the patient in the next X years, predicting emergency department visits will affect their livelihood; therefore, he should be aware of the insurance policies best suited for them.
We are providing a virtual doctor solution to the remote area of India where user can interact verbally with the Ul and tell his/her symptoms and based on the symptoms and past disease history, it can diagnose the disease, suggest some medicines and also can find a real doctor nearby. 

We collect the data regarding the disease and corresponding symptoms from the Wikipedia and other diseases specific website. Then we preprocess the data and fed into the neural network and train our model. 

We train our model using Bidirectional LSTM algorithms science we feed continuous data of stream. 

We scrap social medial website for early prediction of the epidemic outbreak in some locality based on the users post. 

# Our Solutions:
With our software, we intend to have the following features for the betterments in the healthcare sector:
1.	Disease prediction from a patient’s history and health data
2.	A personalized treatment recommendation system
3.	Recommendation system of medicines and doctors 
4.	A system to predict medical insurances for the patients
5.	An alert system for patients if certain vitalities tend to show abnormal behaviours
6.	A system to predict an epidemic outbreak using social media data.
